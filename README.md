# Awesome_Real_Life_Cryptography
implementing the real time cryptographic standards and the recent papers in the field  of cryptography with  emphasis on devops for seamless application of the given  protocols .
## For Standard Implementation of Cryptographic Protocols
[ RFC 7748 - elliptic curve security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748) :- consist of  implpementation standard for curve25519 and X3DH
(link for the implementation)[/lab2]

[Understanding the crypto](https://rmusser.net/docs/Crypto_Encrypt.html)

Then going from theoretical  understanding  and implementation of some of the attacks to actually application for network security 


Certificates and PKI  standards 

1. OpenSSL : https://github.com/openssl/openssl . </br> 
  -  the  security analysis and CI implementation for  testing for certificates 
  
 


2. TLS and its implementation on cloud :</br>
  -  for Nginx , ubuntu , node  and other server  frameworks , check their implementation and automate their updation with formalised version  of the framework.







security analysis 

1. from side channel attacks :  doing analysis of major PKI standards  and theirexample application for diffrent SaaS and networking services : [Top PKI services](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/pki).
